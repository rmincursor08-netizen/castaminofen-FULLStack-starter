# Replaceability and Isolation Strategy

## Isolation pattern
- each AI capability should own its own interface and adapter package
- product modules should depend only on interfaces, not provider implementations
- providers should be selected via configuration or dependency injection
- inference jobs should be processed through a queue so the system can scale independently

## Replaceability examples
- swap Whisper for Azure Speech without changing the content module
- change the recommendation model without changing the UI
- switch from Elasticsearch vector search to OpenSearch or a dedicated vector store
- plug in a new LLM provider behind the same interface

## Design rule
AI modules must be swappable, observable, and safe to evolve without coupling the application to a single vendor or model.
