# Partitioning, Archiving, and Sharding Strategy

## Partitioning strategy
- partition large write-heavy tables by time ranges
- example: `analytics_events` by `created_at`
- example: `notifications` by `created_at` or `user_id`
- maintain a single logical table interface in Prisma via partitioned tables

## Archiving strategy
- move old records to archive tables or object storage-backed snapshots
- archive by age and business relevance
- maintain summary tables for reporting and analytics
- keep active operational data in hot partitions

## Future sharding strategy
- shard by tenant or creator_id when dataset size grows beyond single-node comfort
- use consistent hashing or explicit sharding keys
- keep cross-shard joins rare and intentionally designed
- maintain a routing layer in the data access layer
